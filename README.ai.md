As an AI, I can't directly browse your files, but I can guide you on how you can examine your codebase. 

Here's a suggested step-by-step plan:

1. Navigate to the lib/services directory. You can use CLI or your IDE to do this.

2. It's important to first understand the overall architecture and design patterns used in the code. Look for hints in the names of the folders, files, and functions. Look for patterns in how code is structured and organized - is it based on function (Model, View, Controller), feature, or something different? What kind of design principles are at play (OOP, functional programming, etc)

3. Open the relevant service files (probably with names like firecrawl_service.js etc). Check the structure of the code: Look for variable declarations, function declarations and their implementations. Try to understand the different components, how they interact, and how flows of data and control are handled.

3.  Pay attention to the interactions between service files. Many times, higher-level logic is encapsulated within functions that call lower-level functions in other files, or they are interacting with each other through exports and imports.

4. If there's shared code being imported from other locations, make sure to check these as well, trying to understand their purpose and how they tie into the larger codebase.

5. Take notes for yourself as you go through the codebase. Make sure you're keeping an eye open both for broader architectural patterns, as well as smaller details like how individual functions work.

To navigate between directories you can use the `cd` command like this:

```bash
cd lib/services
```
For checking the file you can print its content using `cat`:

```bash
cat firecrawl_service.js
```

Please note this is a very general guideline and would vary based on the actual structure and complexity of your codebase.
