Instructions: The Firecrawl service executions are located in 'lib/services'. They are not in an express application. Search the code to understand the structure of the codebase before offering a solution.

If you need to see the content of a specific file, ask for it by name.

assistant: Thanks for the information. It's clear that this is a project predominantly based on Typescript, due to the presence of `tsconfig.json` and multiple `*.ts` and `*.tsx` files. I also see the use of `vite` and `react` mentioned, indicating a modern, efficient development environment for React-based projects.

The Firecrawl service executions are located under the folder `lib/services`, where two files `analyze-sources.ts` and `gather-topics.ts` are present. These might contain the codes responsible for these service executions.

The services probably don't involve express because there are no signs of it in the directory structure. The system doesn't consist of a typical express structure (with directories like `routes`, `controllers`, `middlewares`, `models`), meaning the code is not organized in a way that an Express.js app would typically be organized.

Notable directories include `app`, which contains various React components and routes; `public`, which typically holds static assets; and `.git`, which stores version control metadata. 

For a more comprehensive insight into the project structure, it would be beneficial to see the content of the following files

1. 'package.json': To get an overview of the scripts, dependencies and devDependencies used in the project.
2. '.env': To see environment variables, if it exists and is not listed due to it being gitignored.
3. 'app/root.tsx' and 'app/routes.ts': To understand the layout and routing structure of the client application.
4. 'lib/services/analyze-sources.ts' and 'lib/services/gather-topics.ts': As it was explicitly mentioned that Firecrawl service executions are in 'lib/services', inspecting these files can provide a deeper sense of how these services work.
5. 'lib/db/collections/news-article/index.ts' and 'lib/db/collections/news-topic/index.ts': These might play a significant role in the operations related to the database.

Let me know, if you want to dive deeper into specific files.
