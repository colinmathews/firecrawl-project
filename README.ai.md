The codebase is organized around different tasks like gathering top news topics, extracting articles from various sources based on a topic, and analyzing articles for media bias. The `firecrawl-base.ts` provides an abstract foundation for interacting with the Firecrawl API, encapsulating the client initialization and error handling. The `gather-topics.ts` and `analyze-sources.ts` use this base functionality and are responsible for specific tasks: like scraping top news topics from Google News, collecting articles related to a topic from different news sites, and analyzing the bias of those articles. The process includes error handling and retry logic to handle transient fails.
